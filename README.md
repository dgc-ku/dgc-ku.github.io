## Projects

### [Pitch Outcome Dashboard - Yankees and Red Sox](https://github.com/dgc-ku/mlb_pitch_dashboard)
Developed an interactive dashboard using **Plotly Dash** showing pitch outcomes of every pitcher for each team with filters for pitch type, pitch speed, and batter-pitcher handedness matchups during the 2024 regular season. Findings include Luis Gil of the Yankees have a commanding fastball in his Rookie of the Year campaign with 51 strikeouts (out of 171 strikes outs total) on fastballs faster than 97 mph. Video demonstration (done originally for my baseball scorecard Instagram account) can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wbxCXq_i8I). Co-authored with Liam Miller.

### [NYPD Arrests Database Research](https://github.com/dgc-ku/nypd-arrests-db-research)
Created and utilized a database of every arrest from January to September 2024 in New York City using **SQL**. We found Brooklyn has the most arrests making up 28% of all arrests in the city and have the most misdeamanors in all five boroughs. Future actionables of this project are to address high-crime areas, including Midtown South and Brownsville, through community support and targeted outreach programs. Co-authored with classmates from CS 3200: Introduction to Databases.

### [Impact of College Sports on Universities in 2009-2021](https://github.com/dgc-ku/college-sports-analysis)
Used **Python** to examine whether college sports in Massachusetts have a significant impact on university demographics, which includes undergraduate enrollment and graduation rates. There is a moderate correlation between college sports revenue and undergraduate enrollment (r = 0.59), suggesting that higher sports revenue draws in more undergraduate students. I also developed a **logistic regression machine learning model** and used 5-fold cross validation that predicts whether or not a university is "successful", with an accuracy score of 65%. Future work for this project includes considering post-NIL data and examining college sports nationwide, as that would improve the accuracy of our model.
