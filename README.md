## Projects
### NYPD Arrests Database Research
Created and utilized a database of every arrest from January to September 2024 in New York City using **SQL**. We found Brooklyn has the most arrests making up 28% of all arrests in the city and have the most misdeamanors in all five boroughs. Future actionables of this project are to address high-crime areas, including Midtown South and Brownsville, through community support and targeted outreach programs. Co-authored with classmates from CS 3200: Introduction to Databases.
